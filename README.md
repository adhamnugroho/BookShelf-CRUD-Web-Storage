# Book-Shelf-CRUD

Project Book Shelf is a website-based application used for book management. In this program, there are 2 shelves, namely the "unread books" shelf and the "books that have been read" shelf.

This application has a system that automatically categorizes "books that have been read" and "books that have not been read". And this application already uses web storage technology which makes the usage experience more comfortable.

You can also perform several actions in this app:
- Add a book.
- Make books read and unread.
- Delete a book.
